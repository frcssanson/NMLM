# Resum√©

In this talk I will discuss the problem of answering questions in natural language using data from a structured Knowledge Base. I will introduce the basic notions of Semantic Parsing, and its application to this specific setting. Most of the focus of the talk will be on giving a general overview on the most common ways that the Semantic Parsing community is following to attack the problem. I will also cover some details of a few popular works in the field.
