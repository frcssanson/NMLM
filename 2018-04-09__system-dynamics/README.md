Identifying system dynamics with machine learning.

# Résumé

In this meetup, we introduce machine learning techniques dedicated to
the identification of system dynamics. From discrete observations of
the system, we determine the local influences of its components. In
the method we develop, the observations we consider as input are the
state transitions of the system. From these observations, we build and
refine, transitions after transition, a logic program that captures
the dynamics of the system. This method allows, among other things, to
learn Boolean networks and to identify cellular automata. This
technique can be applied to bioinformatics, especially for the
identification of a gene regulatory network from observations obtained
through laboratory experiments.

# Bio

Tony Ribeiro did a PhD at the National Institutes of Informatics (NII)
of Tokyo, focusing on the development of methods for learning system
dynamics. During his postdoc at Laboratoire des Sciences du Numérique
de Nantes (LS2N) he challenged his machine learning techniques on real
data coming from biology. His main goal is the production of
predictive model. Taking time series data as input: we have to find
the genes level of expressions, capture the variables interactions and
finally produces predictions under unobserved conditions.
