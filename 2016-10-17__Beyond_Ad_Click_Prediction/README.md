# (hors-s√©rie) Beyond Ad-Click Prediction 

## Description:

We all know machine learning is great for helping you tag friends on
Facebook, suggesting what brand of toothpaste will improve your smile,
and picking the ad most likely to unlock your wallet. In this talk,
however, I hope to demonstrate for you that there are some interesting
applications you may not have thought of, such as detecting landmines
from radar, finding orangutans in the Bornean Jungle, or helping a car
avoid pedestrians.
