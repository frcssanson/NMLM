# Personalized and preference-based recommender system w/prob relational models

A personalized and preference-based recommender system using probabilistic relational models

## Résumé

Recommender systems aim at discovering potentially interesting items
for users from a (usually large) collection of items. Most of the
recommender systems implemented today deal with the problem of
recommending simple, inexpensive, or frequently purchased items, such
as books, movies, music, news, restaurants etc. and usually demand
users’ profile for making recommendations. Relatively few works on the
application of recommender systems for recommending expensive or less
frequently purchased items (e.g., real estate properties, flights
etc.) can be found. This talk will present a recommendation approach
that uses probabilistic relational models for making personalized
recommendations from users’ preferences in a system where items are
not purchased frequently and user profiles are not readily
available.
