# (Almost) 50 shades of Random Forest in a practical business context

## Résumé

In this meetup, we focus on some of the challenges using machine learning, focusing on Random Forest, in a B2B predictive lead scoring context. The aim: accelerate the sales processes giving priority to the prospects most likely to become the next customers. We will detail the challenges with the different data sources (companies' revenues declaration and online news/press releases, external sources, ...), the use of Random Forest to understand users' market as well as the textual information coming from online sources, its advantages to understand the variables' importance and in the Active Learning process to select the most important samples to label.

## Bio

Filippo Mazza did a PhD in Informatic Engineering, focusing on the analysis of face pictures in social networks. Later he started to work at Sparklane where he applies its machine learning techniques to a different case: the evaluation of companies in a B2B context. His task is to manage the predictive models that suggest companies who's their next best potential customer.
